# BasicItemSync
Syncs items and other key completion between players in SSMP.
See the [commands section](#commands) for a list of all the things this mod syncs.

> This mod is very much in beta. Please report bugs here: https://github.com/BobbyTheCatfish/Silksong-BasicItemSync/issues

## IMPORTANT USAGE NOTE
BasicItemSync currently only supports completely synchronous playthroughs.
This means that **all players need to start from completely fresh save files**, and **new players should not join** midway through a playthrough.
Items that are obtained will only be sent to players currently connected to the server. **They will not be re-sent for new players.**
